%% (Fix fragmented scans)

% If patient's scans have been fragmented for some reason
% - meaning their full brain scan is split into 2-3 different
% NII files: Use this script to combine them into a single NII

concat_scans

%% (Add hypo- & hyperdense lesion maps)

% If patient suffered an infarct, as well as a haemorrhage and
% now exhibits hypo- & hyperdense regions: Use this script to
% combine them into a single lesion map, while controlling for overlaps

add_lesion_maps

%% Check Bounding Box

% Use this script to check if all scans/lesion maps have the same
% bounding box (181x217x181)

Check_Bounding_Box_and_Max_Value_new

%% Calculate lesion size

% Use this script to calculate the lesion size for every patient

get_lesion_size

%% Fix Origin

% Use this script to change the origin of every patient's lesion map
% from [-90, -126, -72] to [-90, -125, -71]

FixOrigin_nii

%% Mask Ventricles

% Use this script to mask (aka cut out) the ventricles and cerebellum
% from the lesion maps, to make them fit the ch2bet template better

Mask_Ventricles_edited

%% Move Origin for LQT

% Use this toolbox to change the lesion maps' dimensions from (181x217x181)
% to (182x218x182), which is required for the Lesion Quantification Toolbox
